# Vehicle Detection and Count Graph

This project uses YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and tracking in a video file. It updates the count graph of detected vehicle classes every 30 frames by default. You can change this interval by modifying the value of the `plot_update_interval` variable.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install ultralytics
pip install matplotlib
